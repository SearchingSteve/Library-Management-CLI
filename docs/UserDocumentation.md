## 1. Overview
 
This application is a **Library Management System** developed to streamline the management of **library items**, **authors**, and **patrons**. The system enables users to **add, edit, and remove** both authors and library items (which include two main types **books** and **periodicals**).
 
### Key Features:
 
- **Library Items Management**:
  - Library items can be **added, edited, and removed** in the system.
  - Each item is associated with its **author** and is added to the **author's list of works** as well as the **libraryâ€™s collection**.
 
- **Author Management**:
  - **Authors** can also be **added, edited, and removed** as needed.
  - Each author maintains a **list of authored items** (a record of books or periodicals they have written).
 
- **Patron Management**:
  - **Patrons** are able to **borrow and return items**, with each borrowed item tracked for each individual patron.
 
- **Display Management**:
  - The system provides options to **display library items, authors, and patrons** based on specific input criteria:
    - **Input a blank value** to display all items, authors, or patrons.
    - **Input a single ID** to display the corresponding item, author, or patron.
    - **Input multiple IDs separated by commas** to display multiple specified items, authors, or patrons at once.
 
For ease of use, the application includes an option to initialize **mock data** for demonstration and testing purposes. This comprehensive setup allows users to efficiently manage and display all aspects of library administration.

## 2. How to Start and Access the Application
 
1. **Setup**: 
   - Ensure you have Java installed.
   - Place all Java files in an organized directory structure according to their package names (e.g., `main.library`, `main.items`, etc.).
 
2. **Running the Application**:
   - Compile all Java files using a Java IDE or the command line:
     ```bash
     javac main/library/LibraryMenu.java
     ```
   - Run the main menu:
     ```bash
     java main.library.LibraryMenu
     ```
   - You may also run the application in your favourite IDE using the built-in runtime environment. **Ensure you have all neccesary packages and extensions downloaded.**
   - The program's menu will now be displayed in the command line interface. Input the number that corresponds to the part of the program you wish to access (1-15) and press return, and follow the on-screen prompts to proceed.
   - Once you are done using the application, return to the main menu, and type option "15" to exit.
